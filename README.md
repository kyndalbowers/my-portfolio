# my-portfolio

## Description

Created the beginnings of a professional portfolio webpage to display projects I work on throughout the bootcamp and on my own.  This is to create a space to allow potential future employers and collaborators to see my talents and what I have to offer.

## Usage

Utilizing the URL, access the webpage from any electronic device.  Responsive design elements and media queries will alter the display to fit the screensize.
